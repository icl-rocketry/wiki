                    <p><strong>Emergency Response Procedures to Incidents for all Outdoor Engine Test-Fires (at Silwood Park Campus)</strong></p><p><span>This document covers a non-exhaustive list of possible incidents which may occur during a test-fire, to which a set of Emergency Response Procedures (ERPs) has been produced. It is expected that all members of the Propulsion Safety Team, and all team personnel are familiar with this document and its contents before any flight can commence.</span></p><p><strong><u>Incidents and Classification</u></strong></p><p><span>For the purpose of clarity, “incidents” are defined in this context as any event not considered in the standard test-fire procedure that occurs during the actual execution of the test. In the event of any incident, the severity must be assessed. For all purposes and intents, incidents will be classified and logged according to two key categories:</span></p><ol><li><strong> </strong><strong><span>Minor Incident</span></strong><ul><li><span>Any unusual or unexpected flight behavior from the engine under cold operation, which does not result in any harm to personnel whatsoever</span></li><li><span>Any failure of components that does not result in damage to the engine or test bay, and does not result in any harm to personnel whatsoever</span></li></ul></li><li><strong> </strong><strong><span>Major Incident</span></strong><ul><li><span>Any unusual or unexpected engine behavio</span><span>r which results in damage to the engine, pipework, test bay or environment, or causes harm or injury to personnel</span></li><li><span>Any failure of components that cause damage to the engine, pipework, test bay or environment</span></li><li><span>Any event that requires the need to activate the emergency stop function of the test rig</span></li><li><span>Any significant (imminent/potential) danger or harm to persons, infrastructure, and/or property during testing operations</span></li><li><span>Any event that affects persons not from the project</span></li></ul></li></ol><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><u>Emergency Response Procedures</u></strong></p><p><span>This section details the necessary, standard steps required to be taken in the event of each incident occurring. Note that the procedures involve the following key personnel, including:</span></p><ol><li><span>Chief Test Operator</span></li><li><span>Electronics Technician</span></li><li><span>Safety Officer</span></li></ol><p><span>Note that the above is a strict minimum requirement for staff present during engine operation, but is likely to be more expansive for preparatory activities, including representatives from each sub-team, who ensure the correct assembly of their respective subsystems (Storage &amp; Refueling, Throttle Control, Injector/Ignition, Combustion Chamber, and Nozzle).</span></p><p><span>For the purposes of communication outdoors, airhorns will be supplied (one per group) used to signal different time-critical messages and warnings:</span></p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="wrapped confluenceTable"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong><span>Long Horn</span></strong></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="d869fb62-20a1-4891-8db8-75f1c16171e2">Immediate, impending danger, all personnel to be on high alert for loose flames or shrapnel</span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong><span>Double Horn</span></strong></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><span>Incident has occurred and cannot be rectified, engine is shut off, all personnel to clear take-off area</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong><span>Multiple Horn (5 beeps)</span></strong></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><span>All clear signal</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="auto-cursor-target">The above messages are purely for the purpose of warning, and not for any attempt of rectification to be made by personnel beyond the Operations group.</p><p class="auto-cursor-target">Note that the use of airhorns (opposed to whistles, for instance) is necessitated by the high noise levels observed during test-fires.
