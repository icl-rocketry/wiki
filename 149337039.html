                    <p><br/></p><p><strong>Current Overall Design Strategy and Philosophy</strong></p><p><span>This document is subject to change as we get more information and build a better picture of successful designs and the steps involved in creating them.</span></p><p><strong>Driving Factors</strong></p><p><span>    </span><span>The design strategy for this project is driven by several factors specific to the project, the personal, and the context:</span></p><ol><li><span>Limited Control: Unlike most complex devices, our rockets have very little ability to control their performance following launch. This means that the achievement of our goal is entirely dependant on the design: the impulse, total mass, takeoff thrust, and drag to name a few. Changes made in the production phase affecting mass or drag can greatly change the performance.</span></li><li><span>Learning Project: A main goal for this project is to teach its members about general rocket technology, and by extension the best practices of model rocket design. These are specific engineering fields, and we will be constantly learning new things and receiving new information that will impact our design.</span></li><li><span>Part time: We are all students working on this project, and still have to complete our degrees. This project needs to mesh with its members’ other commitments.</span></li><li><span>Competition: Another main goal of this project is to place well at competition. This requires us to work and design in ways that will get us as many points as possible. This may preclude other priorities that one would normally associate with model rocketry. </span></li></ol><p><br/></p><p><strong>Key Constraints</strong></p><p><strong>    </strong><span>Our project is limited by a few key and specific constraints:</span></p><ol><li><span>Knowledge: We don’t know how to do something, or how to prove something will work, or what alternatives are available. </span></li><li><span>Regulations: We are not allowed to do something, or are not sure if we are allowed to do it.</span></li><li><span>Time: We do not have enough man-hours to do something.</span></li><li><span>Cost: We have a limited amount of money to make and remake designs. </span></li></ol><p><br/></p><p><strong>Design Strategy</strong></p><ul><li><span>Tenets</span></li><ul><li><span>Documentation: Excellent documentation is driven by F2 and helps overcome C1, C2, C3 and C4: </span></li><ul><li><span>Research conducted by individual members needs to be documented effectively to retain this knowledge and make it available to teach to others. This also prevents spending money and time on re-doing research. </span></li><li><span>Design decisions need to be documented to teach others why they were made and what informed these decisions.</span></li><li><span>We do not want to lose knowledge over time, or spend time and money relearning things or re-evaluating design decisions because we don’t have all the data. </span></li></ul><li><span>Communication: Excellent Communication is driven by F2, F3 and helps overcome C1, C2, C3 and C4.</span></li><ul><li><span>Ensures that learning is transferred to the rest of the team.</span></li><li><span>Reduces time and money lost by repeating things to different parties.</span></li><li><span>Ensures understanding of decisions made to prevent wasteful re-evaluation and explanation.</span></li><li><span>Ensures decisions are checked by multiple people to reduce. misunderstandings and accidental errors. </span></li><li><span>Increases effectiveness of documentation.</span></li></ul><li><span>Feasibility: Assessment of  feasibility is driven by all factors and helps overcome all constraints.</span></li><ul><li><span>Ensures that we have the ability to complete and verify designs.</span></li><li><span>Reduces unexpected manufacturing difficulties, and time lost due to this.</span></li><li><span>Ensures alignment of design with competition goals. </span></li></ul><li><span>Design Freeze: Design freeze is driven by F1 and F3 and helps overcome C1, C2, C3.</span></li><ul><li><span>Means that past a certain date, conceptual design cannot be changed regardless of new information.</span></li><li><span>Ensures on-time manufacturing and delivery.</span></li><li><span>Ensures that we produce a working design for competition. </span></li><li><span>Provides extra time for unexpected manufacturing difficulties.</span></li></ul></ul><li><span>Strategy</span></li><ul><li><span>Year 1: Development of Key Technologies and Systems</span></li><ul><li><span>Development and flight testing of sub-scale airframe and dual recovery system, as close to competition spec as possible.</span></li><li><span>Development and static fire of </span></li></ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Solutions</strong></p><ul><li><span>Throttleable Engine - Solution to F1</span></li><ul><li><span>Having an engine and ECU (engine control unit) that can reliably change the thrust of the rocket in flight creates a margin of controllability. As such, certain deviations from: manufacturing issues post-design freeze; inaccurate models; inaccurate initial/atmospheric conditions; can be corrected for. Note that this margin will still be quite narrow.</span></li></ul><li><span>Slack and Drive - Implementation of Design Tenets</span></li></ul>
