<h1 id="IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-Testing">Testing</h1><p><strong>Initial test with small portion of sample 1</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">The nichrome wire in sample 1 was seen to be detached after moulding, hence the sample was squeezed and broken into several small chunks. This was done in order to conduct a small scale test on the ignition characteristics of the sample. For this test the nichrome wire was wrapped around the outside of the small sample chunk and was taped in position using electrical tape. The battery used during testing at this point had drained to 8V. During the test some smoke could be seen but nothing more significant happened. Charring was seen on the specimen where the wire had been. The test was repeated using a shorter length of nichrome wire. The outcome was the same.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Test with sample 2 and then 4</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Sample 2 was tested next to see whether the ignition problem was due to poor contact between the wire and the specimen. Upon testing little smoke was visible and the same charring was present as before. <span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Sample 4 was tested this time with a new battery (9V). The hypothesis was that the aluminium powder in sample 4 would potentially speed up the burning process. The same outcome as seen before ensued.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Burn/Flame test</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">After the prior failures, it was imperative to check whether the &quot;food grade&quot; potassium nitrate burned with a lilac flame. Hence a flame test was conducted to conclude that potassium was present in the mixture. A burn test was conducted on the sample to see whether the samples actually burned. Upon contact with a lighter flame, the small chunk of sample 1 crackled where the potassium nitrate particles were present. Smoke was given off. However the whole chunk itself did not burn.</p></div>

<h1 id="IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-Conclusions">Conclusions</h1><p>Several problems were identified from the tests above. The main problem is the formulation of the samples. The potassium nitrate must be ground into a fine powder to ensure mixing with the epoxy is smoother. The samples also contained many voids within. This can be mitigated by formulating the samples under higher pressure and temperature to suppress void formation. The second problem is the nichrome wire contact and temperature. By increasing the thickness of the nichrome wire and embedding them inside the samples, more of the sample would be in contact with the wire. A larger battery will also have to be used to ensure a large enough current to heat up the nichrome wire to a high enough temperature.</p></div>
