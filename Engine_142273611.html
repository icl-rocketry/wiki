                    <h1 id="Engine-Ignition">Ignition</h1><h2 id="Engine-PotentialModesofIgnition">Potential Modes of Ignition</h2><ul><li>Black Powder (with Potential Extra Oxygen Line)</li></ul><p>Black powder (gun powder) would be distributed around the top of the fuel grain in plastic canisters with a cardboard 'hopper' to stop the canisters from falling down the centre of the engine. A car battery or alternative power source (even a 9V battery could be used) would then allow an electric match to ignite the black powder. If the canisters were ignited in a series, the time allowed between its ignition and the oxidiser flowing through the injector would increase (allowing for more consistent ignition). Also considered the possibility of an extra oxygen line to feed the ignition systems separately, however, this was deemed too complex due to the requirement for an extra oxidiser supply.</p><ul><li>Ammonium Perchlorate with a fuel</li></ul><p>This is typically used in modern solid-propellant rocket motors. The ammonium perchlorate is used as the primary oxidiser and it is paired with a high energy fuel (aluminium for high performance). A low energy fuel, such as <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl-terminated_polybutadiene" style="text-decoration: none;text-align: left;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene</a><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);"><span> </span>(HTPB) </span>acts as a binder. These substances are combined into a pellet. The pellets can be distributed in a similar way to the plastic canisters of black powder mentioned above.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">Most formulations have a burn rate between 1–3 mm/s at<span> </span></span><a title="Standard conditions for temperature and pressure" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">STP</a><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);"><span> </span>and 6–12 mm/s at 68 atm. This suggests that given enough pellets a burn of more than 1 second can easily be achieved hence a long enough time for the oxidiser and solid fuel to combust.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">This form of ignition works very well in theory but the pellets need to be held in place securely since during a prior test-fire the pellets were displaced by the nitrous flow.</span></p><ul><li>Nitrocellulose</li></ul><p>Highly flammable substance. Nitrocellulose can be used in the form of a capsule (such as the aforementioned ammonium perchlorate) or can be used in the form of a cotton swab. A potential problem excluding its volatility is the fact that nitrocellulose will burn through in about 35ms (<a href="http://www.wydawnictwa.ipo.waw.pl/cejem/vol_14_No_2_Early_View/Kuracina.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.wydawnictwa.ipo.waw.pl/cejem/vol_14_No_2_Early_View/Kuracina.pdf</a>). This is a very short burn time which means that the ignition of the nitrous and solid fuel will be difficult.</p><ul><li>Solid Rocket Motor (Disassembled)</li></ul><p>Similar to the black powder method but the 'pellets' will be extracted from COTS solid rocket motors in their packaging.</p><h2 id="Engine-ResultsfromTFE-1&quot;Pablo&quot;">Results from TFE-1 &quot;Pablo&quot;</h2><p><br/></p><h2 id="Engine-ResultsfromTestFireDecember2019">Results from Test Fire December 2019</h2><p>TBF (To be fired)</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="Engine-FinalDecision">Final Decision</h2><p><br/></p>
