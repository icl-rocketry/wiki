                    <p>Note: See the detailed guide here: <a href="142273599.html">How-to: Design Reviews</a></p><h2 id="DesignReviewforDecember72019-NotesforthePreliminaryDesignReview">Notes for the Preliminary Design Review</h2><p><br/></p><p>Key Purpose for this particular review:</p><ol><li>Ensure that Sporadic Impulse is designed to a degree that gives us confidence that we can hit the timelines and can have a full rocket assembled on the launch site. </li><li>A chance for the rest of the team to be updated with the current rocket design.</li><li>Consider manufacturability constraints, design choke points.</li><li>Convince our sponsors that we can deliver the project and that it will be successful.</li><li>If there are tests we need to run, we need to identify them. </li><li>Identify the key design risks.</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>These slides, (probably with minor modifications) will be emailed to people who were not present for the review. As such, try to ensure your slides can be printed easily and that animations etc won't hide information. </p><p><br/></p><p>While not all the dimensions are finalised, we are really interested to review the design idea, the assemble-ability of the rocket and identify risks. As such, if there is a dimension that is not fixed, mark it as not-fixed, give an estimate or bounds. </p><p><br/></p><p>A note on risks:</p><ol><li>There are many different types of risk:<ol><li>Design/manufacture not completed in time, possibly causing other parts to fall behind schedule</li><li>Design not compatible with other parts</li><li>Parts not able to take required loads/arent compatible with other parts when temperatures expand and contract things</li><li>Cost overshoot</li><li>External choke points - ex. Roland doesn't have time to make our part for us now, Swagelok doesn't send us parts, launch event cancelled due to weather/sick RSO, etc.</li><li>Others...</li></ol></li><li>Identify these!! Figure out if they are a show-stopper. If they are, we can allocate more resources </li><li>State any mitigation possible, or if it can't be mitigated, tell us and say we are trusting luck <img class="emoticon emoticon-laugh" src="images/icons/emoticons/biggrin.svg" data-emoticon-name="laugh" alt="(big grin)"/></li></ol><p><br/></p><p>A note on costs and timelines:</p><ol><li>Costs generally should be in the design review, but may be hard to estimate. Please do the cost analysis if there are particularly expensive components in you design (more than ~£50)</li><li>Timeline: identify if you need to wait for anything before you can start work! Identify things that can only start after you are done! Estimate how long it should take you to do things, if it is long/critical. </li></ol><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
