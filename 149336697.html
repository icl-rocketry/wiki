                    <div>G.L.E.I.P.N.I.R-RaR/RMS (Short form Gleipnir) is made up of a sled and a load cell stand both fixed to a large board and is designed for horizontal firing. The engine fits in the sled, supported radially but almost frictionless in the axial direction and at least at the moment the design is to have the load cell fixed to the engine’s injector head. </div><div><br/></div>It is held together, mostly, <span style="font-size: 17.0px;">by T-nuts gripping the inner surface of the aluminium 80/20 extrusions it is made out of. When tightening these nuts, a visual inspection of the nut is required to ensure that it has been tightened in the perpendicular position rather than fitting snugly- but uselessly- parallel to the slot (this can sometimes happen due to slight misalignments in the joints obstructing the nut from turning into the locked position. </span><div><br/></div><div>The ultimate strength of these T-nut joints has not been tested, but it has been observed that using 2 of them is enough to take the weight of an adult male, at least.<br/><div><br/></div><div>The sled part can move about 5-10 cm, far more than it ever needs to but make sure it is not at the very end of this range in the loading direction when it is being assembled for a test fire. </div><div><br/></div><div>For adjustment to fit a different engine, the sled can be adjusted by loosening the t nuts, shifting the bars and around and tightening again, as well as printing new top supports (Preferably ABS), which are based around sections of the circumference of the engine, leaving a gap on top so that the engine is ultimately supported from the top by the aluminium bar in the event that the printed supports break). <span style="font-size: 17.0px;">the bottom supports are very sturdy, all purpose triangles made of fire retardant MDF and don’t need alteration. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div>If the engine is long enough then the load cell stand will need to be moved back, which means new bolt holes (there are 5 fixing it to the board) for it will need to be drilled with a power drill. Simply trace the existing bolt holes backward; they are arranged in a V shape so you can move them back without any issues.</div><div><br/></div><div>For use in the field, find/produce a level surface on the ground and stake the board into the soil through the 4 corner holes. </div><div><br/></div><div>And if you are ever in doubt of the strength of the structure, add more brackets and T-nuts. </div><div><br/></div><div>To do: </div><div>1) Test ultimate strength of T-nut joint; potentially use hydraulic press? </div><div>2) Acquire tap and die to cut threads into some members for safer fixing.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>* God Let Everything Inside Please Not Implode, Research, Reconnaissance &amp; Recreation, Reaction Measurement System</div><div><br/></div><div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div></div></div>
