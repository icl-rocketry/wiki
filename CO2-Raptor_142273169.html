This may add a few extra millimeters to the position of the canister into the Raptor, which means that the canister may not be in the reach of the piercing needle anymore. </li></ul><p>Looking less than a week before the scheduled launch, the team decided to urgently work towards an alternative system. Urgent design bureau was set on the day, and an alternative solution prototype was tested on the day in Prince's Gardens at around 1:00 am (lol)</p><p>Solution: Do not rely on threads, instead clamp the canister tightly against the Raptor, and rely on the tight fit and O-rings to create a seal.<br/><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Author: Dev<br/>Working members: <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention current-user-mention" data-username="dra16" href="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/~dra16" data-linked-resource-id="70157881" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk">Agrawal, Devansh</a>, <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="nfa18" href="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/~nfa18" data-linked-resource-id="96125881" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk">Anyamele, Nnaemeka</a> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="trg18" href="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/~trg18" data-linked-resource-id="93941012" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk">Gir, Tanvi</a> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="sh5915" href="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/~sh5915" data-linked-resource-id="60963206" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk">Harayama, Sena</a> </span></p><p>Log:</p><p>Decided to use laser cut plywood centering rings held by M6 steel <img class="emoticon emoticon-question" src="images/icons/emoticons/help_16.svg" data-emoticon-name="question" alt="(question)"/> rods into the bulkhead. To avoid the CO2 canister to move axially in the Raptor (3/8 inch diameter for canister vs 1/2 inch diameter for the Raptor), small ring shaped inserts were laser cut to be put between the canister and the CO2, just so to minimize axial movement.</p><p>Difficulties: (many)</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Requires flipping the CO2 system compared to the original plan (the centering rings and housing assembly need to not interfere with the pressurisation and even less with the shock chord and parchute)</li><li>Hole in the original bulkhead was sized for the chamfered bit of the Raptor so now needs to be enlarged)</li><li>Needs new holes for the threaded rods, original bulkhead already epoxied on so limited accessibility to do any further modifications.</li><li>Nut and eyebolt already expoxied onto the original bulkhead may interfere with placing additional bulkheads.</li></ul><p>Other notes:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Sleeve on the igniters are there for the charge through the wires to reach the igniter head. Probably could get around with taping. Sleeve needs to be cut to be flush with the hole in the Black powder housing.</li><li>Igniter needs to be secured on the black powder housing by putting 5min epoxy onto the bottom of the sleeve.

Also there was clearly some gas coming out the bottom, suggesting there are some leaks)<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Reasons:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>The canister did not get fully pierced: The clamping assembly was a bit loose, hence there was some leaks between the O-ring and the canister. Also the canister was not centered and got pierced off centered.</li><li>The friction fit between the nosecone and the rocket was probably too tight </li><li>Gas was leaking from the ematch hole, as well as directly from the canister but the wrong way (due to first problem). Some black powder may have been leaking from the pyrohouse through the ematch hole.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Third test: Successful (nose cone and drogue did come off, nose only flew about a meter, so we may want more gas, the canister hole was centered, could be larger but no fix for that)<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Notes:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Ematch hole was now plugged in using white tack </li><li>Nuts were tightened carefully, and we thoroughly checked that the canister was centered. We added a thin strip of masking tape around the canister threads to help with the centering but not sure how much that actually helped</li><li>Used some electrical tape to make sure the ematch wires were not shorting</li><li>Used wood glue to seal the ematch hole.</li><li>At launch, use the 20 grams CO2 canister. Urgently cut some longer rods to accommodate for those.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="CO2Raptor-Assemblyprocedure">Assembly procedure</h3><ol><li>Put shock chord into the black shockchord loop</li><li>Prepare the pyrohousing (put the ematch through, taking care the wires are not shorting, put the sleeve or electrical tape, put some wood glue at the bottom of the sleeve or tape, put and make sure the hole is sealed)</li><li>Black powder: measure, pour, masking tape (or red sticker it)</li><li>Red cap + spring + piston assembly</li><li>Red cap in to the Raptor</li><li>Use the magic stick to pass the ematch through the hole</li><li>Assemble the canister housing and tighten the nuts, making sure that the canister is centered</li><li>Blue tack in ematch hole from the top (pressurized side)</li><li>Wire ematch onto the avionics bay</li><li>Good to go</li></ol>
