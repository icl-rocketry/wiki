<p>One of the original teams founded in November 2018. Currently headed by ICLR founder Will Harradence. Propulsion team is responsible for the design and testing of the hybrid propulsion system (not including any COTS propulsion systems) comprising the ground filling station, nitrous tank, filling system, feed system, throttle control system, and engine itself, as well as any complimentary items, such as fuel casting rigs and testing rigs.</p></div>

This engine was intended as a proof of concept for a throttlable paraffin/nitrous oxide hybrid. Specification was based on current estimates for the thrust needed to fly a low velocity trajectory, as well as the available testing facilities. Pablo was first tested on 24th May, 2019, and the test cell at the University of Hertfordshire. Following unsuccessful attempts to ignite the engine, 1 burn was completed on this date, and data was collected showing a steady state thrust of about 40N.</p><p>Specifications:</p><ul><li>600mm length</li><li>50mm diameter </li><li>80 bar (?) tank pressure</li><li>30 bar chamber pressure </li><li>350N max thrust </li><li>Mach 2.6 exhaust velocity at sea level</li></ul><p><br/>Propellants were Paraffin wax and Nitrous Oxide.</p><h3 id="PropulsionTeam-TFE-1B‘Balthazar’"><span>TFE-1B ‘Balthazar’</span></h3><p><br/>A conceptual upgrade to Pablo featuring a bell nozzle.</p><h3 id="PropulsionTeam-TFE-1C‘Conestantine’"><span>TFE-1C ‘Conestantine’</span></h3><p><br/><span>A slightly modified version of Pablo that was successfully test fired at the university of Hertfordshire in June 2019 where a problematic relationship</span><span> between ignition and injection was highlighted.
