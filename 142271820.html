Nosecone ejected successfully to 6 meters away from the rocket.</li><li>Second test with the parachute assembly inside, again, full rocket minus the fincan. Nosecone and parachute got ejected successfully. Part of the shockchord stayed inside the rocket but should not be a problem in flight since we expect the parachute drag to pull out the rest of the shockchord out the rocket.</li></ul></li><li>Both were successful</li></ul></li><li>Were given launch window, rocket was assembled - rain scrubbed the launches</li></ul><h2 id="id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Thingsthatwentwell">Things that went well</h2><ul><li>Ground test: Both were successful</li><li>Fast assembly - everyone understood what they were doing</li><li>Impromptu s’mores :3</li><li>Very good mood and overall attitude from everyone</li><li>Made a good impression and networked well with the people there from different backgrounds of rocket knowledge/aptitude</li></ul><h2 id="id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Thingstoimprove">Things to improve</h2><ul><li><strong>READ SLACK! TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS! AND SHOW SOME ENGAGEMENT TO POSTS SO WE KNOW YOU'VE READ IT! Communication is key.

Miscommunication on objectives which led to impromptu integration of ignition board built by Shreeyam and Luis onto the rocket</li><li>Add some mass compartments for adjusting mass and stability depending on the rocket design (on top of reprinting new fins to adjust the static margin)</li><li>Tolerancing, especially for 3D printing.</li><li>Some sourcing issues (last minute ordering/lack of components e.g. peregrine, e-matches, shear pins)</li><li>Fuse tape (scotch tape + BP lining)</li><li>Back up shock cord and parachute system</li><li>May want to move away from threaded inserts + screws</li><li>Minimize on site assembly before hand </li><li>Window for opening/turning things on inside the rocket, but without having to open the rocket</li><li>More accessible eyebolts for tying parachutes (take ease of assembly into consideration when designing in general)</li><li>bulkhead affixing process</li><li>No waterproofing of electronics</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><h3 id="id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-RocketManufacturingandAssembly">Rocket Manufacturing and Assembly</h3><ul><li>Obtain components on time, use the department suppliers (eg RS Components, they do next day delivery), complete BOM sheets in as easy and clear a way for anyone to complete transactions</li><li>More drills (assembly rehearsal) in the few days before manufacturing</li><li>If you designed it you should be there to manufacture it, if not your design should be well illustrated (e/g/ engineering drawings, manuals, instructions) that way someone who doesnt know what this particular component can still help manufacture it and put it together.</li><li>CRIMP - Complete Rocket Integration Minus Pyrotechnics</li><li>Not leaving the workshop in a mess.</li></ul></li><li><h3 id="id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Pre-LaunchLogistics">Pre-Launch Logistics</h3><ul><li>Communal checklists</li><li>Get every member to print out copies of the flight manual so we do not have to rely on iPads.
