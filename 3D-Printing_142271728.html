                    <h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Overallworkflow"><strong>Overall workflow</strong></h3><p>In a perfect world, any part would be easily 3D printed as a prototype, and would not require any changes when designed for other manufacturing. Unfortunately due to the way that a 3D printer is just a hot glue gun on a CNC gantry, this is not quite possible, and some things need to be kept in min mind when designing something for 3D printing. Truly, 3D printing should almost always be the <strong>last option you consider. </strong>3D prints are often <strong>heavier, bulkier, and not as strong</strong> as conventional manufacturing methods. Consider laser cutting, or turning and milling if you have access and don't need complex features.</p><p>The overall workflow consists of:</p><ol><li><strong>Generating a CAD model</strong> in your software of choice (Fusion 360 for ICLR), with some key things kept in mind in the design section.</li><li><strong>Exporting an STL</strong> from CAD software. The STL file is a discretisation of the CAD models into many faces and polygons.</li><li><strong>Slice the STL</strong> to produce a gcode file. This file produces raw, very basic instructions for how the 3D printer should move the gantry, acceleration, and extrude filament. Currently the most feature-packed free and open source slicer software is <strong>Cura</strong> from Ultimaker.</li></ol><h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Structureofaprint"><strong>Structure of a print</strong></h3><p>A 3D printed part is made of <strong>walls, infill, top/bottom layers, and support structure</strong> generally.</p><h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Materialproperties"><strong>Material properties</strong></h3><p>The standard settings in Cura make the strength of your part far from isotropic. Generally, the z axis (the direction of the layers) is the weakest, as each layer presents a thin section that is almost universally a weakness and reduces strength in that direction.</p><p>Standard infill is also stacked in the z axis, giving additional compressive strength there. Change the infill pattern to cubic or gyroid to get near-isotropic material properties.</p><h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Tolerancing:"><strong>Tolerancing:</strong></h3><p>Make sure to allow for tolerances in parts before printing them. In general most 3D printing is +-0.2mm on a calibrated printer. (Some cheaper printers may require calibration of steps/mm with a test cube before they can be used to print parts where dimensioning is critical - Eg. Creality Ender 3).</p><h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Supports:">Supports:</h3><p>3D printed materials often require support material to be able to print - eg. for overhangs, etc... These will be added by the slicer program automatically where you need them if you tell it to. If you can design your part to minimize the supports required (ideally eliminate them) you will end up with a better print as supports can be annoying to remove, waste filament and ruin the finish of the part at the locations they are needed. Most printers can safely do overhangs of 45 degrees or less without support, more than this and the print may fail without supports.</p><h3 id="id-3DPrinting-Designfor3Dprinting"><strong>Design for 3D printing</strong></h3><p><strong>A useful external resource for material properties of common filaments: <a href="https://www.simplify3d.com/support/materials-guide/properties-table/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.simplify3d.com/support/materials-guide/properties-table/</a></strong></p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="relative-table wrapped confluenceTable" style="width: 99.8138%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 6.97385%;"/><col style="width: 5.56247%;"/><col style="width: 4.8983%;"/><col style="width: 7.555%;"/><col style="width: 6.22665%;"/><col style="width: 8.88335%;"/><col style="width: 6.26816%;"/><col style="width: 14.4043%;"/><col style="width: 16.0648%;"/><col style="width: 22.9971%;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Material</th><th class="confluenceTh"><p>Young's Modulus [GPa]</p><p>(Material, not part)</p></th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Flexural Modulus [GPa]</th><th class="confluenceTh">Yield/Ultimate Strength [MPa]</th><th class="confluenceTh">Glass Transition [<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">°</span>C]</th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Print Temperature (nozzle/bed) [<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">°</span>C]</th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Z Strength Reduction [-]</th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Common Usage</th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Notes</th><th colspan="1" class="confluenceTh">Cool fax</th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">PLA</td><td class="confluenceTd">3.5</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><br/></td><td class="confluenceTd">40 (Yield), 65 (Ultimate)</td><td class="confluenceTd">60</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">200/50</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">0.8</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">Everything that doesn't need to be printed with another filament.

A print is most likely to fail at the very start.</li><li>When setting a print please remember that the bed and the nozzle heat up before the print. This causes the filament in the nozzle to drizzle. Close to the end of the heating period, take a piece of paper or some clippers and grab this filament and pull it out of the nozzle (keeping in mind that the nozzle is VERY HOT).</li><li>Do not make the mistake of assuming that the bed of the printer you are using is calibrated. Always check if the printer you are using has auto bed levelling and if it does not this can easily be done with a piece of paper. There are many youtube videos showing how you can do this for every different printer.</li></ul>
