                    There is aluminium and there is steel. Aluminium is soft and less dense, steel is hard and more dense. If the metal you’re machining is not on this list then a) you’re making a musical instrument or b) iclr has advanced enough that you probably have real experts to talk to.<div><br/></div><div>Working with steel is a bit more difficult than with aluminium; for example when machining steel you need to ensure you have the right bit (if you try to drill into steel with a steel bit then...) and be mindful of the spindle speed of the machine you’re using- use a slower speed than with aluminium and in general take more time and most importantly make sure the piece you are drilling is as secure as possible (clamp it, make a rig for it etc.) because it will be much more resistant to anything you try to do to it. </div><div><br/></div><div>WEAR GOGGLES when working with metal (especially when machining) because swarf (helical metallic waste) or other chips fly everywhere, it is possible for them to get stuck IN YOUR EYES or under your skin for decades without you knowing it so if you’re ever getting an MRI in the future and you have any concerns then consider that eye x-ray...</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;">Advanced metalwork using lathes or mills is at the moment only really accessible at the hackspace so you will need to be inducted there. Drills cut in and out of a stationary piece, mills drag a cutting bit along the surface of a stationary piece and lathes rotate the piece while you move the machining tool which lets you turn out a diameter or face off end surfaces. </span></div><div><br/></div><div>Outside of basic PPE, ensure that the appropriate tool and speeds are set (look it up beforehand given material, tool diameter/type etc., workpiece is fully restricted (and Chuck key is removed afterwards!), take your time, make small cuts (start with a small bit before stepping up to larger ones of the final diameter you need) and don’t jam a large drill bit 50 mm in one go because it will completely jam up and solidify inside the flute, quite humorously... </div><div><br/></div><div>As for lathes and mills, don’t take off more than 0.2mm of material in a single pass; you can take a bit more if it’s soft stuff like aluminium and don’t care about the tolerance or finish. Obviously, the less you take off in a single pass the better that cut will be. </div><div><br/></div><div>If you need to cut a thread into a pre-existing hole, you can actually cut it manually<span style="font-size: 17.0px;"> pretty easily with the right tap and die set, in which case consider getting cutting and tapping compound/paste (green gunk that makes your life easier).</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 17.0px;font-style: normal;">Also please understand that files only cut one way (forwards) so try to use proper technique  because dragging it forward and back and will clog it up (aluminium) or potentially damage it (steel); yes, it’s a pet peeve.</span></div>
