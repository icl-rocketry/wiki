Objective and Background {#IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-ObjectiveandBackground}
========================

This ignition system is based on advice from the Waterloo Rocketry team.
It uses a modified version of the NRX propellant developped by Richard
Nakka :<http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/rnx_for.html>.

Procedure - Casting {#IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-Procedure-Casting}
===================

Ignition leads were made from 1 mm copper wire, with ignition wire being
0.1 mm nichrome wire. In future, a larger nichrome wire would be
preferred.

1.  Nichrome wire was soldered to the copper leads using a solder paste
    and lighter. The nichrome was soldered in the middle of the leads,
    creating short extensions of the leads beyond the joints to help
    center the nichrome in the NRX-M puck.
2.  Blue foam cylinders were cut, about 10 mm diameter and 40 mm long.
3.  KNO~3~ was weighed using the scale, then set aside.
4.  Epoxy resin was weighed in the casting cup.
5.  Epoxy hardener was weighed in the casting cup, and mixed.
6.  KNO~3~ was slowly added to the resin/epoxy mixture, mixing
    continuously.
7.  The nichrome was wrapped around the middle of the foam cylinder,
    with the leads lying along the axis of the cylinder.
8.  The foam and wire assembly was slowly pushed into the NRX-M mix and
    left to set.

Testing {#IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-Testing}
=======

**Initial test with small portion of sample 1**

The nichrome wire in sample 1 was seen to be detached after moulding,
hence the sample was squeezed and broken into several small chunks. This
was done in order to conduct a small scale test on the ignition
characteristics of the sample. For this test the nichrome wire was
wrapped around the outside of the small sample chunk and was taped in
position using electrical tape. The battery used during testing at this
point had drained to 8V. During the test some smoke could be seen but
nothing more significant happened. Charring was seen on the specimen
where the wire had been. The test was repeated using a shorter length of
nichrome wire. The outcome was the same.

\

**Test with sample 2 and then 4**

Sample 2 was tested next to see whether the ignition problem was due to
poor contact between the wire and the specimen. Upon testing little
smoke was visible and the same charring was present as before. [Sample 4
was tested this time with a new battery (9V). The hypothesis was that
the aluminium powder in sample 4 would potentially speed up the burning
process. The same outcome as seen before
ensued.]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}

\

**[Burn/Flame test]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}**

After the prior failures, it was imperative to check whether the \"food
grade\" potassium nitrate burned with a lilac flame. Hence a flame test
was conducted to conclude that potassium was present in the mixture. A
burn test was conducted on the sample to see whether the samples
actually burned. Upon contact with a lighter flame, the small chunk of
sample 1 crackled where the potassium nitrate particles were present.
Smoke was given off. However the whole chunk itself did not burn.

Conclusions {#IgnitionSystemFeasibility-NRXPropellant-3Dec2019-Conclusions}
===========

Several problems were identified from the tests above. The main problem
is the formulation of the samples. The potassium nitrate must be ground
into a fine powder to ensure mixing with the epoxy is smoother. The
samples also contained many voids within. This can be mitigated by
formulating the samples under higher pressure and temperature to
suppress void formation. The second problem is the nichrome wire contact
and temperature. By increasing the thickness of the nichrome wire and
embedding them inside the samples, more of the sample would be in
contact with the wire. A larger battery will also have to be used to
ensure a large enough current to heat up the nichrome wire to a high
enough temperature.
