**SHREK Design Review**

**By Shrey**

\

*Project timeline:*

Push launch in 2 February

Read dev's article on slack - 5k with I class motor

Transport to EARS - check sunday buses

\

*Propulsion:*

Buy motor for collection on launch site - cloud cover could lead to
lower clearance, gives us flexibility to purchase lower power motor if
necessary

Get a 3 or 4 grain casing - can use in future

Undamaged 3 grain casing may be available

\

*Engine Bulkheads and Centering Rings:*

Consider laser cutting from ply rather than 3d printing

4/6mm ply should be enough

use fusion smh rohit grrrrrr

Centering ring inside case - inside fin lock

Add dims to screenshots

Don't epoxy the casing - want to be able to reuse it

What's stopping it from falling out at the bottom - can't be flimsy,
needs to withstand chute shock loads

Test by dropping off a balcony

Need to be able to slide the casing plus motor into the rocket at launch

\

*Fins:*

Consider epoxy to join finsÂ 

Individual L1 certificates a possibility - use a kit rocket

Do them on the same day as SHREK?

Have multiple launch opportunities to allow for weather etc.

Print with thick trailing edge and sand it down - easier to manufacture

Don't really need it at this level - could use flat fin

\

*Nosecone:*

Preferably make fins larger rather than adding mass

\

*Electronics:*

Ordering electronic parts before christmas?

Arduino Mega

Ground station app

\

*Parachute:*

Chute too big

Descend rate 9ms-1 is good enough

\

*Shock chord:*

Expensive shock cord

\

*General recovery:*

Mention the system that Cesaroni comes with

Consider ejecting engine and having parachutes come out the back

Use time from burnout to apogee from openrocket to set delay charge

Apogee detect on flight computer
