A guide to being able to do a proper design review, and to be able to
prepare appropriate slides.

What are Design Reviews, and why do them? {#How-to:DesignReviews-WhatareDesignReviews,andwhydothem?}
-----------------------------------------

1.  Design reviews are basically huge meetings where the design for a
    system or subsystem is presented. It is a chance to ensure that the
    design is
    1.  suitable,
    2.  manufacturable,
    3.  integratable, and
    4.  will meet the necessary deadline and cost
2.  Design is always evolving, and so every team member designs their
    parts to a prior specification. Design reviews ensure that the
    design is still compatible and will still work. 
3.  Usually external reviewers are present, so they can provide their
    experience and point out things the team might have forgotten. Also
    a chance to ask them for their advice on the design.
4.  There are three stages of a design review:
    1.  Concept Design Review (CoDR) - Verify a design concept; identify
        key design risks going forward; ensure that the design can meet
        the requirements set by the customer
    2.  Preliminary Design Review (PDR) - Detailed design ideas and
        usually with most key dimensions defined; Verification of
        performance; manufacturability of tricky components discussed.
        Key risks on timeline, assembly, etc should be discussed.
    3.  Critical Design Review (CDR) - Full design must be complete by
        this time, with exact masses and performance estimates. All
        manufacturing dimensions and details confirmed. 
5.  Essentially, the design review is there to predict if a design will
    work: ensure your review **both** shows that it will work, **and**
    highlights how it might fail. BE HONEST, and don\'t hide things.

Step-by-step guide to preparing a design review doc {#How-to:DesignReviews-Step-by-stepguidetopreparingadesignreviewdoc}
---------------------------------------------------

**There are templates in ICLR Drive \> 10k SRAD 2020 \> Reviews for each
sub team.**

1.  The format is not so critical - it could powerpoint slides, or a
    word-doc style design report
2.  The overall system review needs:
    1.  Mission statement - what are you trying to do, why?
    2.  Mission level requirements - what defines a successful mission?
    3.  Mission overview/concept of operations (CONOPS) - a description
        of how the mission works and all the stages involved
    4.  Subsystem breakdown - describing how the work is broken down,
        helps guide reviewer when they open the various presentations
    5.  Cost, Timeline
    6.  Risks:
        1.  Describe key design risks in meeting the mission
            requirements. 
        2.  Rank them to make sure the critical ones are first. 
        3.  Identify show-stoppers: what, if it went wrong, would
            immediately prevent the mission from succeeding. Identifying
            this allows you to plan for contingencies. 
3.  Each subsystem needs:
    1.  What specs are you designing to/what must your subsystem be able
        to do?
    2.  What designs have you considered (optional, but often very
        useful to guide the reviewer), which design did you pick, and
        why did you pick it?
    3.  Describe the materials needed, manufacturing methods, assembly
        methods, and if not obvious, design implications for other
        teams?
    4.  Provide a mass/power/length of rocket requirement for your
        component 
    5.  If there are various alternatives and all could work, the design
        review could (but technically should not) be a place to pick the
        suitable design.
    6.  If relevant, describe how to assemble the parts together
    7.  Not every detail needs to be in the main slide deck. Use the
        appendix and backup slides to include more details. 
    8.  If including CAD/simulations/videos, add some key screenshots in
        the slides, and feel free to switch to a different software
        during the review if helpful. Be careful though as this can
        often take a lot of time. 

Notes: {#How-to:DesignReviews-Notes:}
------

1.  While you are presenting, anyone and everyone is supposed to ask you
    questions. These can be either for clarification or to challenge
    your design. Please don\'t take this personally.
2.  It\'s very easy to get derailed during a design review, and end up
    in a questioning rabbit hole. Feel free to tell the person who is
    questioning you to hold onto the questions until after the review,
    in the interest of going through the entire review. 
3.  See old design reviews for a reference. 
4.  Sometimes CAD isn\'t the right solution for a design review. Yes,
    having a full CAD assembly can be useful to ensure things fit and
    are to scale. But often a quick, semi-accurate sketch is more useful
    during a review to ensure you can get the point across. So feel free
    to make a sketch and get the key dimensions in them. 
5.  During the review, the reviewers, and team members can make notes
    directly on the google slides slides at the relevant slide. This
    allows us to go through 
6.  DO NOT USE ANIMATIONS that hide other parts of your slides. If you
    want to do this, split it over multiple slides. This allows us to
    print the slides/send a pdf to other reviewers offline.
