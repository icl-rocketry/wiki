**Following the Launch Day of 17/11/2019, the new launch protocol below
is recommended.**

**Recognize LaunchDay Tasks are different from General Personnel Tasks
that will be coming soon. **

[Personnel LaunchDay Task Updates:]{.underline}

-   Leads:
    -   Refer to the new Task updates
-   SubTeam Leads
    -   Refer to the new Task updates
-   Members:
    -   Prepare among own teams for your personal \'Primary\' task and
        \'secondary\' task.
        -   Primary: Your specific Launch protocols as defined by each
            subteam.
        -   Secondary: Your general task to do to help setup the
            launch-site

\

[Supply Management Updates:]{.underline}

-   Vehicles & Transportation
    -   To ensure Vehicles are a Go
        -   Photographical evidence of key items are to be uploaded onto
            a new \#LaunchDay slack channel. 
            -   Forms, tickets, travel plans, bus keys, etc\....
-   Tools
    -   Due to a number of missing/lack/surplus of various tool types
        and fits, each subteam should have their own set of tools for
        the parts they designed for.
    -   SubTeam Lead tasks have been updated as a result. 

\

[Rocket Assembly Updates (TASK OF LEADS):]{.underline}

-   Personnel Distribution
    -   3 to a rocket component, and no more unless specifically
        requested from SubTeam Lead
    -   Problems occured when 10 ppl swarmed a component, drowning out
        voice of Leads and subsequently slowing down task completion
    -   Each member must bring an extra pair of clothes to stack onto
        their expected weather, as worse weather conditions may occur. 
        -   Extra Gloves, hats, extra socks are HIGHLY Recommended

\

-   Environmental Adaptation Protocol
    -   Windy.com use
        -   Due to shift in weather, weather prediction became
            unreliable and rained moderately as a result. 
        -   Above offers a real-time coverage of location & final
            decision maker for launch GO/NO-GO Decision
    -   If weather prediction is over 8% chance of precipitation, Launch
        is a NO-GO (Debatable)
    -   Mobile Heating
        -   Some launch conditions are too cold to be anticipated.

    -   Mobile Workbench
        -   Spreading out the rocket caused multiple delays in assembly
        -   <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oypla-Portable-Folding-Outdoor-Camping/dp/B071HPSCBD/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=foldable+outdoor+table&qid=1574175720&refinements=p_76%3A419158031&rnid=419157031&rps=1&sr=8-14>
    -   Mobile Shelter
        -   The below image is proposed. Cheap, and relies on an already
            mobile & stable vehicle
        -   [![](attachments/142271788/142271793.png){.confluence-embedded-image
            .confluence-thumbnail
            height="245"}]{.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper
            .confluence-embedded-manual-size}
        -   Tarp covers worktable in a arrowhead format, prevents rain
            pooling
        -   Ensures only 2-3 people are ever present for final assembly
