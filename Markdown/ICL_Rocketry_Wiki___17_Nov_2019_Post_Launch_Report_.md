Summary {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Summary}
-------

Key Objectives for the day {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-KeyObjectivesfortheday}
--------------------------

-   Apogee Heavy: Testing of 3D printed fin can with slotted fins,
    simultaneous booster ignition, chute release, and Shreeyam\'s flight
    computer
-   November Rocket: Testing 3D printed fin can, black powder ejection
    system 
-   Ground Ejection Test
-   Introduce team to launch ops

What happened? {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Whathappened?}
--------------

-   Prepped things to go
-   Poor weather/visibility - drizzle on arrival
-   No launches ![(sad)](images/icons/emoticons/sad.svg){.emoticon
    .emoticon-sad}
-   Had ground tests
    -   Ejection tests - with and without parachutes
        -   2 grams (approx. because of precision of scale), loaded onto
            the canister, and wired to Luis\' board
        -   First test without a parachute, just the rocket assembly
            minus the fincan. Nosecone ejected successfully to 6 meters
            away from the rocket.
        -   Second test with the parachute assembly inside, again, full
            rocket minus the fincan. Nosecone and parachute got ejected
            successfully. Part of the shockchord stayed inside the
            rocket but should not be a problem in flight since we expect
            the parachute drag to pull out the rest of the shockchord
            out the rocket.
    -   Both were successful
-   Were given launch window, rocket was assembled - rain scrubbed the
    launches

Things that went well {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Thingsthatwentwell}
---------------------

-   Ground test: Both were successful
-   Fast assembly - everyone understood what they were doing
-   Impromptu s'mores :3
-   Very good mood and overall attitude from everyone
-   Made a good impression and networked well with the people there from
    different backgrounds of rocket knowledge/aptitude

Things to improve {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Thingstoimprove}
-----------------

-   **READ SLACK! TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS! AND SHOW SOME ENGAGEMENT TO
    POSTS SO WE KNOW YOU\'VE READ IT! Communication is key. (Please,
    even drop a lil emoji reaction and it would make me less stressed)**
-   ### Test Objectives Planning {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-TestObjectivesPlanning}

    -   Leaders\' responsibility tbh, but we know about that and are
        working on it
    -   More communication about the objectives, early on to the team
        members
    -   What are the launches even actual for??! Do we all know?? Ground
        tests too?
    -   Design review, risk assessment
    -   Split 3 weeks: 3-4 days conceptual design \> design review \>
        improvements/iteration \>  final DR \> planing for
        manufacturing \> manufacturing \> testing \> final logistics
        review \> pre-flight review

-   ### Rocket Design {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-RocketDesign}

    -   Design review needs to happen
    -   Simulations need to be checked and rechecked\... 
    -   Hole alignment!!! + entire interfacing and attachments in
        general \> radial indexer or clocking marks on 3D printed
        components
    -   Stick with 4\'s and 8\'s, not 6, for radially aligning fin cans,
        holes, etc.
    -   No flat head screws, use hex-head screws instead  - use Allen
        Keys too, much easier to use.
    -   Ground test: confusion on the ground test, open air test or
        static test inside the rocket? Miscommunication on objectives
        which led to impromptu integration of ignition board built by
        Shreeyam and Luis onto the rocket
    -   Add some mass compartments for adjusting mass and stability
        depending on the rocket design (on top of reprinting new fins to
        adjust the static margin)
    -   Tolerancing, especially for 3D printing.
    -   Some sourcing issues (last minute ordering/lack of components
        e.g. peregrine, e-matches, shear pins)
    -   Fuse tape (scotch tape + BP lining)
    -   Back up shock cord and parachute system
    -   May want to move away from threaded inserts + screws
    -   Minimize on site assembly before hand 
    -   Window for opening/turning things on inside the rocket, but
        without having to open the rocket
    -   More accessible eyebolts for tying parachutes (take ease of
        assembly into consideration when designing in general)
    -   bulkhead affixing process
    -   No waterproofing of electronics

<!-- -->

-   ### Rocket Manufacturing and Assembly {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-RocketManufacturingandAssembly}

    -   Obtain components on time, use the department suppliers (eg RS
        Components, they do next day delivery), complete BOM sheets in
        as easy and clear a way for anyone to complete transactions
    -   More drills (assembly rehearsal) in the few days before
        manufacturing
    -   If you designed it you should be there to manufacture it, if not
        your design should be well illustrated (e/g/ engineering
        drawings, manuals, instructions) that way someone who doesnt
        know what this particular component can still help manufacture
        it and put it together.
    -   CRIMP - Complete Rocket Integration Minus Pyrotechnics
    -   Not leaving the workshop in a mess.

-   ### Pre-Launch Logistics {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Pre-LaunchLogistics}

    -   Communal checklists
    -   Get every member to print out copies of the flight manual so we
        do not have to rely on iPads. RTFM if there is one!
    -   Pack spares and annotate that they are spares so that we do not
        confuse them with the main 
    -   Assigned responsible members for each task! (responsible
        engineers + chief engineer for the rocket engineer)
    -   Add tool list and time on top of the procedures on the flight
        manual
    -   Smaller and more organised and labelled compartments
    -   Maybe have a dedicated \"technician\" who keeps track of the
        tool
    -   Too large working space, tarp was too big  

-   ### Launch Site Ops {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-LaunchSiteOps}

    -   Spares, bring \'em
    -   Use flight manuals RTFM
    -   Do not wrap the shock cord around the parachute to increase
        chances of correct deployment
    -   Misplaced items such as chute release - organisation needs
        improvement
    -   Struggled to measure black powder mass in back of car, maybe use
        vials/volume measurement
    -   Network even more, get to know what different people at the
        launch site are doing, gain some intel: not just for ourselves
        as Airframe and Recovery team members but also some bits of info
        that could be used for other teams.

Next Steps {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-NextSteps}
----------

-   Conceptual design of Sporadic Impulse is due mid December, we have
    less than a month for that, team should focus on that 
-   Evaluate the current state of the rockets from Sunday, see what
    needs 
-   Fly the rockets hopefully first weekend of December at EARS
    (Cambridge), not a full team outing
-   More ejection tests in Princes Gardens or Wormwood Scrubs (vary
    amount of black powder and record pressure inside?)
-   Subscale generative design bodytube project to be launched soon

\

Learning Points {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-LearningPoints}
---------------

\

-   Pick up union minibus keys the day before (the week before, Union
    services can be slow, and they are only open on week days) since you
    can't pick up keys early morning or during weekends
-   Bring thick gloves and many layers
-   Make sure we have traceability of the motors
-   Should take portable shelter\... A gazebo?
-   More inductions to people (Hackspace, Fusion 360, Valispace,
    OpenRocket, manufacturing)

-------------------------

Miscellaneous {#id-17Nov2019Post-LaunchReport-Miscellaneous}
-------------

-   Penguin huddles are effective at keeping people warrmmmm!
-   When I say it\'s going to be cold, it is going to be real cold. Wear
    layers!
-   Appreciate the collaboration from people, bringing water, snacks for
    people, food runs, drivers, and basically everyone bringing each
    other\'s mood within the team!
