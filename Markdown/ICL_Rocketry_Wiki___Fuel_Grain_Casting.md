Paraffin wax:

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

Setup: 

</div>

<div>

-   Mittens, lab coats and goggles
-   Some kind of ventilation in the room
-   Metal beaker
-   Mini stove
-   Ladle
-   Wax pellets and/or wax to be recast
-   Aluminium Casting die + piston (henceforth called casting rig) with
    bottom plate to be bolted on and clamped on opposite sides. 
-   Hydraulic press: ready to be used, i.e set to the right height and
    gauge reset.[ Have casting rig ready in the press with piston in
    most of the way but with a small gap for
    pouring. ]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
-   [Tray or scrap paper to catch wax under
    press]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
-   [Cardboard screen around casting rig ]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}

Procedure:

</div>

</div>

<div>

-   Place wax in beaker and heat on stove, when melted keep heat at a
    level where no visible vapours are burning off.
-   Once fully melted bring to casting rig, pour in until roughly 2/3
    [full.]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
-   [Start to pump the hydraulic press until the piston and plunger are
    inside the rig and reading on the gauge reaches 1; it's about 30
    degrees clockwise from starting
    position. ]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
-   [As the wax cools the pressure will start to drop so pump
    appropriately to keep it at 1. At the start this will be quite
    frequent but will slow down.]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
-   [When pressure reading has stopped dropping for 5 minutes and rig is
    safe to touch release hydraulic pressure and remove cast fuel by
    unclamping and unbolting bottom plate, then using plunger and piston
    push it out gently. ]{style="font-size: 17.0px;"}
