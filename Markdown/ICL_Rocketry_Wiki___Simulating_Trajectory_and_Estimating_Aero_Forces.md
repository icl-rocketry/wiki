A team from Southampton (led by Simon Box it seems) have written (at
least) two really good papers on how to a) estimate the aero forces on
the rockets and b) to simulate the trajectory, including the parachute
based descent. 

\

Paper on trajectory simulation:

Paper on aeroforces calculation:

[[![](rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/142274883/1){height="250"}](/download/attachments/142274881/AerodynamicCoefficients.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1575776155000&api=v2){.confluence-embedded-file}]{.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper}

\

\

They have combined these into a tool called \'Cambridge
Rocket\', <http://cambridgerocket.sourceforge.net/technicaldetails.html>,
which contains a windows application, Octave implementations and even a
MATLAB zip folder with all the necessary functions. 

\

Methods used: 

1.  Aeroforces: uses a modified barrowman\'s method for normal force
    estimation, uses a DATCOM method suggested by Mandell (1973). 
2.  Trajectory: Essentially uses a earth-centered axis system, storing
    state as the position, the quaternion describing the orientation,
    and the linear and angular momenta. As such it is a 3+4+3+3 = 13
    element vector. 

\

I am keen on developing a more user-friendly python version with strong
API interfaces so that we (and other teams in the world) can use and
develop it further. Perhaps call it pyRocket? (unfortunately this name
is taken by some totally non-rocketry related application, rocketPy is
available though, so may that?)

One key functionality I want to add in is the ability to use an external
control function, especially for the PI controller that the sims team is
currently developing. 

\

I need to think a little bit about the layout of the code, such that
everything is held in classes neatly, such that future functionality can
be added easily.

\

Key requirements:

1.  Easily run a monte-carlo type set of simulations to see what the
    variances are
2.  Easily define the thrust curve of the rocket
3.  Easily add in a control loop on the thrust, and maybe on other
    controllers like actuated fins etc.
4.  Analyse ascent performance, maybe include parachute descent since it
    is actually really straightforward
5.  Allow for multiple boosters

\

Optional benefits:

1.  Import directly from openRocket/rocksim formats (since it might be
    easier to define a rocket there or other people can work on the
    openRocket sim, and then the file can be ran in this python package
    to study the controller/the gaussian behaviour)
2.  Structural loads analysis on components and fins using the
    approximate aerodynamics?
3.  Simulate the launch rod flight region
