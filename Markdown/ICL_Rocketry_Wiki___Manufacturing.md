-   [Always design for holes of 2\^n since it's easier to fold
    paper.]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}
-   [Measure out on paper.]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}
-   [Try to either print out paper on a 1:1 scale with a line marking
    where exactly along the circumference you want to drill
    holes.]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}
-   Make sure to test whether the paper goes all the way around such
    that it is visible to you that the holes are at the right angle.
-   If you mess up after you've drilled the holes, rotate the body tube
    to put your new holes such that the holes are maximum distance apart
    from the failed holes.
