Overview {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-Overview}
--------

A.P.O.G.E.E was the first rocket by the ICL Rocketry team. It was
launched at the Black Knight Rocketry Club launch site [on 24 March
2019. It reached an apogee of 870 meters, weighed 2.585 kg, and is
designed to deliver a total impulse of
486Ns.]{style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"}

Objectives {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-Objectives}
----------

A.P.O.G.E.E was launched in order to familiarize members of the team to
what launching a rocket would be like. For many members, A.P.O.G.E.E\'s
launch was the first time they had participated in a rocket launch.
A.P.O.G.E.E\'s launch was also aimed at testing several critical systems
the team had designed for the 2020 (competition) rocket, [HMSS Sporadic
Impulse](HMSS-Sporadic-Impulse_142271167.html). A.P.O.G.E.E. was meant
to test components such as the recovery and avionics systems the team
had designed.

Production {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-Production}

Production was conducted in the Aeronautics Student Workshop at Imperial
College.

Launch {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-Launch}
------

The launch took place at [Black Knight Rocketry
Club](http://www.blackknightsrocket.club/){.external-link} launch site
at Oxhill, Warwick, CV35 0RD.

Evaluation and Results {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-EvaluationandResults}
----------------------

-   Apogee of rocket was overestimated by OpenRocket simulation - 870 m
    real apogee as opposed to the predicted 1018 m
-   Rocket was angled into the wind at launch site to compensate flight
    path, decreasing actual apogee height compared to the predictions
-   Originally-installed accelerometer provided extremely noisy and
    unusable data, and subsititute In-flight computer was only
    configured to record apogee and maximum velocity, which is tabled
    above

Reflection {#A.P.O.G.E.E.-Reflection}
----------

-   Consider time delays for manufacture and acquisition of components
    (print time, order lead times, mistakes/retakes, etc.)
-   Take care to consider handling of components, ensure (as much as
    reasonably possible) components do not break during
    manufacture/assembly
-   Further familiarize team members with manufacturing processes
-   Record launch rail angle for OpenRocket simulation
-   Spray paint (dry 24 hours) then varnish did not work (As soon as
    varnish was applied and the undried part was touched, the entire
    layer of paint peeled off)
-   Consider epoxy drying times, and consider order of assembly for
    epoxy-ing parts together. Note that epoxy nozzles are single use and
    occasionally time needs to be taken between steps
-   Try as much as possible to have consistent diameter throughout
    entire height of rocket, otherwise may face complications mounting
    to launch rail
-   Always advance parallel design architecture in case main design
    fails, so that a back-up is present
-   Consider on-site assembly procedures; having dozens of screws on a
    windy site with grass everywhere is perhaps not ideal
-   Pick a parachute color that contrasts with the sky so that
    deployment is clearly visible, orange is a good colour
