Compressed nitrous oxide is the oxidiser which powers Sporadic Impulse,
and to date, TFE-1 Pablo and TFE-2 HyPNos. Owing to the oxidising, as
well as sedating nature of nitrous oxide, it is imperative that a COSHH
analysis be performed, and that it is treated with the utmost care. The
following is a comprehensive list of the hazard codes and safety
precautions related to the storage, handling and use of nitrous
oxide \[1\]:

H270 - Oxidiser (may cause or intensify fire):  care taken to not
release unnecessary fluidl;

H280 - Contains gas under pressure; may explode if heated: stored away
from sources of heat/sunlight and in a locked environment;

H336 - May cause drowsiness or dizziness: PPE (face mask) worn when
handling;

OSHA-H01 - May displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation: PPE (face
mask) worn when handling;

CGA-HG01 - May cause frostbite: PPE worn (face mask, insulating gloves)
worn when handling.
