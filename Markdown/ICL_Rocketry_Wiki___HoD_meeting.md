Agenda:

\

-   Present ICLR, what we have been doing
-   Current membership around 70 members, with the vast majority of the
    students being in first and second years
    -   Survey results:
    -   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLY179nZx_KXSGlEvtsxb9TB4dHvhyXgu8SyGg-2Uus/edit#gid=772014663> 
        -   51 responses gauge engagement of our members with the
            project and assess how valuable they think being part of the
            project is
        -   average of 8 hours a week into the project
        -   4.4 score for how valuable this project has been to
            experience at Imperial
        -   3.7 score for how valuable being in this project has been to
            job applications
        -   4.5 score for how happy ICLR makes them
        -   Main problems: (Talk about them later in the last part of
            the conversation)
            -   Balancing work
            -   Getting more manufacturing capabilities
            -   Getting more money
-   Relationship between the Department and us
    -   We are happy and members seem to be happy as well
    -   Balancing work but is worth it
    -   Check whether this is something that the Department is happy
        about
-   Reinforcing taught curriculum
    -   hands on practice
-   In doing so, reinforcing communication generally and developing
    positive relationship based on mutual support 
    -   Manufacturing capabilities
    -   Space
    -   More freedom with legal stuff
        -   Is there anyway we could exist as a legal entity or to
            create set procedures to facilitate financial support of the
            project from external sponsors?

Minutes

Involve Mirko in the drone recovery project?

This year\'s GDP for Mirko could be drone recovery

Send link to website once finished

Set a non profit on the side? Risk goes to the student so not favorable

Should be a way of receiving donations surely

Office that deals with charitable donation? They can talk to them about
it

Manufacturing esp metal working

Streamlined procedure for facilitating inductions 

Only way is Mech eng where they had dedicated machines and dedicated
teaching technicians and courses to teach the students on how to use the
machines

If we limited the number of people from the team (like 2) to use their
facilities, would it be possible to get access to the Mech Eng workshop?

Priority 1 and Priority 2 system for workshop for workshop
manufacturing, but it only applies to curricular project, which we are
not
