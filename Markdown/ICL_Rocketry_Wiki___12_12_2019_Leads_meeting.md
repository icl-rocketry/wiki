-   Airbourne Engineering
    -   They may be thinking that we have dropped the ball on that topic
        hence need to follow up with them.
    -   Might be happy to let us do some testings such as proof pressure
        testing etc so that\'s good
    -   Make sure that all tubing and pipes have been properly cleaned!
        No grease before welding otherwise its bad\
        -   Use gloves (we do not want grease from hands to get on)
        -   Would be good to inform physics people that it\'s going to
            contain a very strong oxidiser
        -   Fyi, having some grease will start a pretty bad exothermic
            chemical decomposition
    -   Would need to go to Wescott 
    -   Roxel said they would get back to us after Christmas
-   Start conversation with BOC representative on campus
    -   Order through technicians, get them ordered on campus and then
        transport it to Silwood?
    -   Best is to ask them to somehow deliver directly to Silwood
    -   Ordering through union would allow us to save on VAT? \>
        Actually the university also claims VAT during tax times or
        whatever but we do not get it back as a project
        (*bureeaaucracyyyy)*
        -   May want to discuss with Ela on negotiating whether we can
            get back the VAT back to our budget
-   Timeline
    -   Very tight yes
    -   So far \> Decoupled top of the rocket from the bottom side which
        is highly dependent on propulsion system performance
    -   Fly the rocket with just a COTS motor? Tank \> put a cylinder
        with no end caps since we have a spare cylinder
-   Engine performance and environment dependency
    -   We are the only team who is considering environment (understand
        temperature)\'s effect on the performance of the engine and to
        have specced it to the Desert\'s condition
    -   Dr Knoll: Silicone heater pad stuck onto the tank and fly it
        (100 grams) just wrap it around and tape it
    -   Two varieties: DC low current high voltage (12 V and 24 V) or AC
        (easier cause we could get a portable generator but might not be
        able to store enough power IPS (interrupted power supply)) Power
        would most probably not be supplied on board the rocket.
    -   Cable leads connected to the alligator clips at the bottom of
        the rocket connected to the generator and have it pop up at
        launch.
    -   Do a calculation on how long it\'s going to take for the tank to
        cool down/heat up
    -   Fill tank and run tank is kept warm, heating on both end,
        cooling via evaporation 
-   Tank stainless steel as structural component (still awaiting
    response from competition organisers)
-   Chute Release and general recovery redundancy \
    <https://www.herox.com/SpaceportAmericaCup2020/forum/thread/4508>
-   Hackspace \> only have the lathe working 
    -   Send small group every week to get inducted such that we will be
        able to use it in the future
    -   Else, need to figure something else out
