<p>An ignition method comprising of a small solid rocket motor placed inside the hybrid combustion chamber was tested. It was testing by firing the small motor. Afterwards, the casing of the small motor and the hybrid were examined. It was observed that although lots of heat was generated, the casing still contained a clay or ceramic nozzle after burnout. This poses a danger to the hybrid engine, and so this ignition method was deemed unfeasible.</p></div>

<h1 id="IgnitionSystemFeasibility-SmallRocketMotor-26Nov19-ObjectiveandBackground">Objective and Background</h1><p>The primary objective of this test was to examine the feasibilty of using a small hobby rocket motor as the ignition charge for a hybrid engine. In particular, the test was to examine what remained of the small motor after burnout, and whether or not this would safely burn up inside the engine once it was started.</p><p>In general, hybrid ignition systems require a sustained generation of heat with a flame temperature of at least the decomposition temperature of nitrous oxide, which is about 900degC.Â  However, the ignition system must not compromise the safety or integrity of the engine.</p></div>

<h1 id="IgnitionSystemFeasibility-SmallRocketMotor-26Nov19-Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Althought significant heat was produced over a period of about 1 second, it was determined that the leftover casing was substantial and durable, and could not be expected to be reliably destroyed by the ignition of the hybrid, thus posing a safety risk. This method of ignition will not be pursued.</p></div>
