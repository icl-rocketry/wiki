                    Wood is very useful when you need something relatively big in any dimension because it’s cheap. It’s also very easy to work by hand. <div><br/></div><div>Wood is either timber, i.e a literal piece of tree, or manufactured board which is a composite of timber/timber chips/dust/other waste and some form resin. </div><div><br/></div><div>With timber there is hardwood, such as oak, beech and ash (and balsa wood! The names aren’t entirely accurate!), and softwood- for example pine, larch and yew. <span style="font-size: 17.0px;">Essentially hardwoods come from your broadleaf trees with big proud branches and majestic leafs that make your garden look hideous on a wet, cloudy autumn afternoon, while softwood comes from coniferous trees, evergreen, needle-leafed, with so many branches on the trunk it’s clear they’re compensating for something. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;">What this means is softwoods are absolutely littered with knots (places where a branch has joined with the trunk) which love to dry up and fall out leaving holes. Hardwoods grow slower (more expensive) and are usually denser (again, exceptions such as balsa) and hence harder. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;">Working with timber is easy, but it’s important to keep track of where anything is actually square, because timber is extremely anisotropic and will warp as it dries or takes on moisture. So if you ever really care about the precise shape of your piece, first cut an edge with a bandsaw (using the alignment rail) to declare that as your starting point for all measurements. This also applies for manufactured board because you just can’t trust whether someone cut it straight in the first place. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 17.0px;"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Manufactured boards include MDF, plywood, chipboard and many others. Chipboard is the vomit inducing stuff they make your school desks out of that you see when the veneer/plastic edge cover comes off. MDF is compressed wood dust mixed with resin; it is very dense and is roughly isotropic, so it’s hard to set alight and super duper convenient to work with, and you don’t need to worry about it warping. Plywood is made up of unravelled sections of leg arranged in a composite laminate with alternating grain directions, hence the surfaces are still hard and the it not only doesn’t warp but doesn’t really expand much with humidity anyway. The resin content is pretty high however and this can make it flammable so keep it away from direct fires. </div><div><br/></div><div>You may yet come to love the flexibility, ease and availability of material when working with wood and decide to buy a woodworking plane. For some reason, some people have hundreds of them in their workshops and I think it looks really silly. Unless they’re collections, some places have little souvenir or decorative planes and I find that adorable. </div><div><br/></div><div>PS: Don’t smell the freshly cut plywood, it’s bad for you of course, I have no idea why they let it smell so good. </div>
