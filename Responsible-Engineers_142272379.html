This person will be responsible for that part, meaning they will be held accountable for whatever happens with the part. This does not mean that 100% of the design and manufacturing needs to be done by the responsible person. In fact, the responsible engineers are free to get some help, work with other people, and delegate bits of the design and manufacturing to other members. However, they will be held accountable to deliver the part on time and under budget. If leads or any other people have questions regarding the current state, future strategy, design details or engineering decisions on their part, they are expected to be able to answer them. They will also be the ones who will be presenting about the part during design review sessions, and will be responsible for updating the specs of the part on Valispace.  </p><p>The responsible engineer's sheet is expected to evolve through time, as the design changes. It's leads and subleads responsibility to make sure all tasks and components are shown on the sheet. Members can help with this by letting leads know if they think anything is missing from the sheet. Members are free to edit descriptions on their part if they think it needs some clarification. </p><p><br/></p>
