                    <p>This article details the operating procedure for test-fires from January, 2020 onward. <span>This document is a record of the chain of events that are expected to occur before each test-fire that is to be conducted at Imperial College Silwood Park Campus. Non-conformance to this standard procedure will be considered as a lapse in safety, and follow-up action and consequences may follow in such an event.</span></p><p><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><strong><u>External Testing at Imperial College Silwood Campus</u></strong></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Administrative Matters</strong></p><ol><li><span>The intention to test must be conveyed to the Propulsion Safety Officer at least 7<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="2f08c600-63af-4877-bc8e-902d173a3cbc"> days</span> in advance of the desired test commencement day. This request should include the following information, in the form of a mission plan:</span><ol><li><span>Desired test commencement time</span></li><li><span>Expected number and duration of test-fires</span></li><li><span>Testing objectives and procedures</span></li><li><span>Personnel involved</span></li><li><span>Logistical requirements</span></li><li><span>Any other pertinent information</span></li></ol></li><li><span>A Chief Operator and Electronics Technician and Nitrous Specialist are to be appointed for the test. The previous two roles, as well as the Propulsion Safety Officer must all be members of ICLR leadership, except under circumstance of necessary unavailability.</span></li><li><span>The Safety Team is to perform a risk assessment of the desired activity. Should the risk assessment not fulfill all safety requirements, the activity is <strong>not</strong> to proceed.</span></li><li><span>The Safety Team is also to inform the relevant contacts from the Silwood Park Campus regarding the test(s) that are going to be conducted, with the same level of detail as with (1).</span></li></ol><p><br/></p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><ol><li>The Nitrous Oxide tank is to be stored in a gas cage (well-ventilated) near the Hamilton building at Silwood Park Campus. (<u>Provisional</u>), with a protective rain cover.</li><li>The engine, test rig, and N<sub>2</sub>0 transport trolley (without tank) are to be stored in the Drive Field laboratory (<u>Provisional</u>).</li><li>All consumables, sensors and electronics are to be stored in an airtight box at Imperial College South Kensington Campus, in a locked cupboard (<u>Provisional</u>).</li></ol><p><span> </span></p><p><strong>Pre-Test-fire Preparations and Engine Assembly</strong></p><p>Transport and advance checks:</p><ol><li><span>The weather forecast for the Silwood Campus must be checked at 2000hrs on the day before the departure. Should there be forecasted inclement weather, the test must be postponed.</span></li><li><span>The weather forecast should be checked again at 1 hour before the departure time. Similarly, should there be inclement weather forecast, the test must be postponed.</span></li><li><span>All personnel leaving the South Kensington campus for the Silwood Park Campus must be dressed appropriately in long sleeves, long trousers/jeans, and covered shoes. Non-conformance results in denied travel to the test site. There must also be enough PPE to protect absolutely all personnel during the test-fire, as well as relevant members during assembly.</span></li><li><span>The equipment checklist (appended) is to be completed prior to departure from South Kensington Campus.</span></li><li><span>All personnel present at the test site must sign into the attendance log.</span></li><li><span>All personnel are to be briefed regarding the following matters:</span><ol><li><span>Exclusion zone during test-fires;</span></li><li><span>Location of fire-extinguishing materials, and first-aid kit in the area;</span></li><li><span>Use of airhorns for warnings and rapid information dissemination;</span></li><li><span>Evacuation route;</span></li><li><span>The use of personal protective equipment (ear defenders) during testing.</span></li></ol></li></ol><p><span>Before operations begin:</span></p><ol><li><span>The Chief Operator is to ensure that on the engine assembly table in the laboratory, the following documents are available and clearly visible:</span><ol><li><span>General Test-fire Standard Operating Procedure;</span></li><li><span>Test-Specific Operation Procedure (for the actual tests being carried out on the day);</span></li><li><span>Assembly and preparation checklist.</span></li></ol></li><li><span>All personnel put on high-vis vests.</span></li><li>The engine is assembled - all active members of personnel equipped with all relevant PPE (detailed in the attached Risk Assessment document).</li><li>Immediately before any tests are conducted, personnel is split into three groups:<ol><li><em>Operations group</em> (Chief Operator, Electronics Technician, Safety Officer) - behind Drive Field Laboratory;</li><li><em>Left group</em> (half of remaining personnel) -  to the left of Drive Field Inn, stopping oncoming traffic;</li><li><em>Right group</em> (other half of remaining personnel) -  to the right of Drive Field Inn, stopping oncoming traffic.<ol><li><strong>Note</strong> that, due to the above configuration and the requirement for transportation of the nitrous oxide tank, the <strong>minimum number of personnel required</strong> is 3 (Operations group)+1 (Left)+1 (Right)=<strong>5</strong>. </li><li><strong>Current assignments</strong> (subject to change for each test; confirmation and training completed at least <em>7 days</em> in advance of activity): <em>Chief Operator</em>: William Harradence; <em>Electronics Technician</em>: Shreeyam Kacker; <em>Safety Officer</em>: Filippos Geragidis; <em>Nitrous Specialist</em>: Rafal Sokolowski</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The green light is to be given by the Chief Operator and Electronics Technician, upon completion and checking of the checklist.</li></ol><p><em>Setup Procedure:</em></p><ol><li>Collect parts from Drive Field laboratory.</li><li>Inspect all items for transport/storage-induced damage.</li><li>Nitrous tank setup:<ol><li>Transport N<sub><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);">2</span></sub>O tank from gas cage to Drive Field Inn, using transport trolley - at least 5 members of personnel required.
