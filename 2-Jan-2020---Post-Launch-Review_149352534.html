A few learning points:</p><ul><li>No chute release - no one seems to find them reliable</li><li>Length of shock cords to be balanced to form the V. The nose cone end must lie further down than the lower part of the rocket under the drogue chute. Then the main gets deployed off the nose cone end. </li><li>Parachute packaging tips (essentially just stuff it in, but shroud lines and shock cords can be stored on the outside of the bag using some elastic cord.</li><li>Ejection caps using centrifuge tubes in brass pipes. Reusable and reliable. <br/>(Embed the ejection charge in the middle of the centrifuge tube that has bp filled in it, and with wadding at the top to hold the BP in place so it can't shake around). </li><li>AV bay with dual rocket split is a classic method</li><li>Not all nylon screws are made equal. Every manufacturer and every batch can be different. Ground tests must be done using  screws from the same batch as those that will be flying.</li><li>Parachute has an apex, and the drogue attaches there to literally pull the main out. </li><li>Direction of ejection charge going off isn't important - ie. if the ejection effectively blows and stuffs the parachute deeper in a body tube that isn't strictly bad. </li><li>(there's much more but I can't remember at the moment)</li></ul><p><br/></p><h2 id="id-2Jan2020-PostLaunchReview-Attendees">Attendees</h2><ol><li>Dev</li><li>Sena</li><li>Cisco</li><li>Rafal</li><li>Filipos</li><li>Omar</li><li>Danielle</li><li>Nicole</li><li>Thomas</li><li>Michael</li><li>Ananya</li><li>Ming Jie</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>Driven by the amazing John</p><p>(note, he is keen on building his own rocket for next time)</p><h2 id="id-2Jan2020-PostLaunchReview-GoodContactsfromtheday">Good Contacts from the day</h2><ul><li>Andy </li><li>Andy (yes there were two Andy's, and they were both incredibly helpful)</li><li>John Timberlake</li></ul><h2 id="id-2Jan2020-PostLaunchReview-GoodPeopletolookinto">Good People to look into</h2><ul><li>Collin Rowe</li><li>Jim Jarvis - amazing carbon fibre stuff</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2 id="id-2Jan2020-PostLaunchReview-Extranotes:">Extra notes:</h2><ul><li>DroneSoc booked the union minibus.
